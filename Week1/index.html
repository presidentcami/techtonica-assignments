            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Brown the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter begins to foam and turns a
                    golden
                    brown,
                    emitting a nutty aroma. Take butter off the heat and allow to cool.</li>
                <li>In a small mixing bowl combine the butter and the sugars and mix well. Add the egg yolk, and vanilla
                    extract
                    and mix
                    until smooth and homogenous.</li>
                <li>Add the flour, salt and baking soda. Mix until just combined and no streaks of flour remain. Last,
                    fold in
                    the
                    chocolate. Do not over mix.</li>
                <li>Shape into 2 huge cookies or 2 medium size cookies and place on your prepared cookie sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for 11 minutes*, or until the edges are just golden brown and the centers have puffed up but
                    are still
                    gooey.</li>
                <li>Allow to cool before eating!</li>
            </ol>
